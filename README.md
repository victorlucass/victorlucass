## 👦 **About me**

I'm a Brazilian software developer living in Manaus, Amazonas. I've been working with technology since 2020 and during this period of my professional life, I've worked with the most diverse types of projects such as: **front-end**, **back-end** and **mobile**.

If you ask me about my favorite project that I've ever worked on, I would always say that it's the one coming next. I believe that each new project comes with its own unique set of challenges and opportunities for growth. I believe that there is always space to improve ourselves.

I have two main **goals**:

**My first goal** is to improve my skills as a web and mobile software developer helping to make people's lives easier.

**My second goal** is to share my knowledge, like how I have acquired and keep acquiring knowledge through the experiences, lessons, and tutorials. I aspire to pass on my knowledge and if possible, make a positive impact on someone's life.
